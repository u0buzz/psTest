general information

The Government Team for Response to Computer Emergencies of Ukraine CERT-UA received a notification from the subject of coordination on the distribution of e-mails among state bodies of Ukraine. Attached to the letter is the archive "501_25_103.zip", which contains the eponymous shortcut file. If you open an LNK file, an HTA file will be downloaded and executed on your computer. The latter contains VBScript code, which will download and decode the bait file and the malicious program LoadEdge, which, in turn, should ensure the destruction of the computer by other malicious programs from the arsenal of the group: TunnelMole (DNS backdoor), RC2CL or others.

The activity is associated with the activities of the UAC-0035 group (InvisiMole). Note that the date of compilation of the malicious program LoadEdge - 24.02.2022.

In addition, facts have been revealed that indicate the development of the malicious program LoadEdge, at least since February 2021.
